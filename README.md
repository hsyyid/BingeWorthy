# BingeWorthy

BingeWorthy allows you to share what music you are listening to with your followers through a simple feed of music and comments. Instead of going out of your way to hunt down the link to a song, video, etc. to share with friends, BingeWorthy does it all for you, ready to share in one click.

## Technology

We built the project with a serverless architecture, using React Native for the frontend and Amazon Web Services for the backend.

The backend was created in NodeJS and uses various AWS services such as Cognito, DynamoDB, Lambda, and API Gateway - our Rest API runs on Lambda.

We built the feeds using [getstream](https://getstream.io) which allowed us to save some time on building the backend.
